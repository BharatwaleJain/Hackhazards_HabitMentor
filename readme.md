# 🚀 HabitMentor

> Build lasting habits through science-backed methods, visual tracking and social accountability

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
**PS 9 - Build the Ultimate Digital Habit Builder**

---

## 🎯 Objective
HabitMentor addresses the challenge of sustainable habit formation. It serves individuals who struggle to maintain consistency with their personal development goals. The app bridges the gap between intention and action by combining visual tracking, social accountability and behavioral science principles to make habits stick. By addressing the high failure rate of habit formation (estimated at 80% within 2 weeks), HabitMentor helps users transform aspirations into lasting lifestyle changes.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
(Solo Participation)

### Team Members:  
- Aarjav Jain ( [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharatwalejain) | [GitHub](https://github.com/BharatwaleJain) )

### Your Approach:  
- I chose this problem because habit formation is universally challenging yet critical for personal growth
- Due to ongoing semester final exams, I had limited time and opted for a simpler problem statement that I could execute effectively
- I focused on implementing core behavioral science principles rather than integrating sponsor technologies due to time constraints
- Main breakthrough was the idea of trigger-action-reward loop that behavioral science identifies as essential for habit formation

## 🏁 Final Words
Working on HabitMentor for the Hackhazards Hackathon was a journey in exploring how technology can bridge the gap between intention and action. Instead of relying on complex tech, I focused on simple thoughtful design rooted in proven behavioral science principles. With minimal code but maximum impact, HabitMentor shows how strategic UX choices can transform everyday behaviors and help users build lasting habits through science-backed methods.
